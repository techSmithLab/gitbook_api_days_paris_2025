## API Basics

All API requests use the base URL:

```
https://api.evolvepayments.com/v1
```

The API uses standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returns JSON responses. All requests require authentication using your API key.

> **Note**: Start in test mode to experiment safely. Your test API key begins with `ek_test_` and will never charge real cards.

Let's get you set up with [authentication](authentication.md) next.
