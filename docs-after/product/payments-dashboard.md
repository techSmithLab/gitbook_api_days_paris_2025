# Payments dashboard

## Dashboard Overview <a href="#dashboard-overview" id="dashboard-overview"></a>

The Payments Dashboard is the control center for your account. It's where you check how payments are performing right now, investigate specific transactions, and configure the tools your team uses every day.

Most teams start their day in the dashboard: a finance lead might check last night's volume and payouts, an operations manager might scan for failed payments or disputes, and a developer might verify that a new integration is working as expected. The sections below explain how the main areas of the dashboard fit into that daily workflow.

### **Main Navigation**

The dashboard is organized into primary sections accessible from the left sidebar. As you move between them, your quick stats bar stays in view so you always have context on how your payments are performing.

* **Overview**: Real-time transaction summary and key metrics
* **Transactions**: Detailed transaction history and search
* **Analytics**: Access to Reporting and Usage Insights features
* **Settings**: Account configuration and team management
* **Enterprise**: Advanced features like Smart Routing and Smart Forecasting (Enterprise accounts only)

### **Quick Stats Bar**

At the top of every page, you'll find a live snapshot of how your payments are performing. This gives you a quick way to answer questions like How much did we process today? or Is our success rate normal? without leaving what youre working on.

* Today's transaction volume and count
* Current success rate percentage
* Active payment methods
* System status indicator
